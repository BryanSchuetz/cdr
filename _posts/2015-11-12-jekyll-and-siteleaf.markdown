[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Siteleaf](://www.siteleaf.com), two great tastes that taste great together. You get the power, flexibility, and portability of Jekyll—and you get the easy to use, client friendly, GUI goodness of Siteleaf. What’s not to like?

This freebie starter theme is a simple fixed-width, adaptive blog template. It's fixed-width because I hate fluid layouts. It's adaptive because **_mobile_**. The grid is controlled by a couple of simple [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) mixins. Basically, you set the width of your columns and gutters, center the grid on the viewport, and let the column count be determined by whatever breakpoints make sense given the content. Simple.

Not sure what I'm talking [about](/about/)?

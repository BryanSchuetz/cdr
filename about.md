[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a deceptively simple Ruby-based static site generator. It powers [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), is one of [the most popular](https://www.staticgen.com) generators around, and now at version 3.0 includes a host of great features like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Coffee Script](http://coffeescript.org) support, [custom content types](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [data files](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/), [Liquid templating](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid), and tons more.

[Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com) helps you use Jekyll with clients. **Specifically, it provides a well designed web-based interface to your Jekyll application that content managers can actually use.** Getting non-technical subject matter experts on board with any kind of Jekyll workflow has always been the biggest challenge of using Jekyll with clients. They don't want to hear about build scripts, or Github repos, or file name conventions. Siteleaf lets your content managers shortcut that steep Jekyll learning curve by giving them the beautifully simple web-based interface they deserve. Want to add an image? Just drag and drop. Adding structured metadata? It's point and click.

Jekyll + Siteleaf are two great tastes that taste great together. You get the power, flexibility, and portability of Jekyll _and_ you get the easy to use, client friendly, GUI goodness of Siteleaf. What's not to like?

This freebie starter theme is a simple fixed-width, adaptive blog template. It's fixed-width because I hate fluid layouts. It's adaptive because _mobile_. The grid is controlled by a couple of simple Sass mixins. Basically, you set the width of your columns and gutters, center the grid on the viewport, and let the column count be determined by whatever breakpoints make sense given the content. Simple.
